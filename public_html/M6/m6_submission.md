<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I created a trap (black square), with the same dimensions as the target<br>square, that causes the game to end when the player collides with it.<br>I first created the object itself by defining its properties. I then created<br>a function called &quot;moveTrap()&quot; which spawns the trap&#39;s location randomly around the canvas<br>every time the game refreshes and called the &quot;moveTrap() function under the &quot;start()&quot;<br>game function to spawn it at a random location every time the game<br>starts. Then, I called the &quot;moveTrap()&quot; function with the &quot;collide with target&quot; code<br>so the trap randomly spawns with the target every time the player collides<br>with the target. Lastly, whenever the player collides with the trap, the game<br>timer is immediately set to 0, which causes the &quot;endGame()&quot; function to be<br>called, stopping the game.<div><br></div><div><b>Note !!!:</b>&nbsp;Occasionally, the trap will spawn right next to the<br>player&#39;s square at the start of the game causing the game to end,<br>just refresh the page again.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I changed the behavior of the target to make it move away from<br>the player when the player enters a 150px radius of the target sprite.<br>First I created a function, &quot;calculateDistance()&quot; that calculates the distance between the player<br>and the target and assigned the function call to the &quot;distance&quot; variable under<br>the &quot;draw()&quot; function. Then the code checks if the distance variable is less<br>than 150px, if it is then the target begins to move away from<br>the player opposite to the player&#39;s direction. Lastly, to prevent the target sprite<br>from moving off the canvas, I used a series of if-else statements to<br>restrict the target&#39;s movement when it collides with the canvas boundaries.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>(I used arrow comments pointing at the code snippet block) This code snippet<br>shows the updated target collision.

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>(I used arrow comments pointing at the code snippet block) This code snippet<br>moves the target away from the player when the player enters a specific<br>radius from the target. First, the code calculates the distance between the player<br>and target by calling the &quot;calculateDistance()&quot; function. If the distance is less than<br>150, then the target begins to move in the opposite direction away from<br>the player at around half the player&#39;s speed. Lastly, the code prevents the<br>target from moving off the canvas boundaries by causing it to collide with<br>the canvas dimensions, restricting its movement to any other direction other than the<br>direction of the borders.<br></p>

Lastly, I learned how to use event<br>listeners to register player movement when certain keys, specifically the arrow keys, are<br>pressed.<br></p><br></td></tr>
